## How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
**Objects are mostly data, its "An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).**


## What are some advantages to creating object literals?

**You write less code, and you can store information and combine them into more stuff. "It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database."**


## How do objects differ from arrays?


**Objects represent a special type of data that are used to store information. Array is a special type of variable that is used to store lists.**



## Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.

**If the object name is defined you can't use Dot notation you have to use brakets, "Dot notation is generally preferred over bracket notation because it is more succinct and easier to read. However there are some cases where you have to use brackets. For example, if an object property name is defined at runtime then you can't use dot notation to access the value, but you can pass the name as a variable inside brackets"** 

## Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
//const dog = {
  //name: 'Spot',
  //age: 2,
  //color: 'white with black spots',
  //humanAge: function (){
    //console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  //}
//}
