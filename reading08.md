## Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.

**"Flexbox is a layout mechanism designed for laying out groups of items in one dimension. Learn how to use it in this module."
## Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.

**The main axis is defined by the flex-direction property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it, "The main axis is the axis running in the direction the flex items are laid out in (for example, as rows across the page, or columns down the page.) The start and end of this axis are called the main start and main end." and "The cross axis is the axis running perpendicular to the direction the flex items are laid out in. The start and end of this axis are called the cross start and cross end."**

## How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

**Performance issue, it can increase the time it takes to load the page.**
