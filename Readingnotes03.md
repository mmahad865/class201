## "The margin is an invisible space around your box. It pushes other elements away from the box. Margins can have positive or negative values. Setting a negative margin on one side of your box can cause it to overlap other things on the page. Whether you are using the standard or alternative box model, the margin is always added after the size of the visible box has been calculated."

## "The border is drawn between the margin and the padding of a box. If you are using the standard box model, the size of the border is added to the width and height of the box. If you are using the alternative box model then the size of the border makes the content box smaller as it takes up some of that available width and height."
