## Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

**It stores the information, "This means that when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. If you close an application on your desktop and re-open it, its most recent state is restored." **

## What information should not be stored in local storage?

** You shouldn't store sensitive information with local storage.**

## Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

**Local storage stores string data, "Using strptime() , date and time in string format can be converted to datetime type."**
