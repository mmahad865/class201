## What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

**The alt element describes the image, the next attribute we'll look at is alt. Its value is supposed to be a textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow internet connection.**

## How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

**Write a full alt next, add a description in the HTML.**

## Why is it important to make images accessible.

**"Images make content more attractive and easier to understand for many users and specifically for those with cognitive and learning disabilities. They serve as cues for people with visual impairments to orient themselves while navigating the content of a web page. Without considering accessibility, images can become a barrier to communication."**

## Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

**When you have a lots of pictures its better to use figure element, "These are created for exactly this purpose: to provide a semantic container for figures, and to clearly link the figure to the caption."**

## Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

**GIF (Graphic Interchange Format) is pictures or videos that will loop forever, and svg (Scalable Vector Graphics) uses icon, and diagram, "Vector image format; ideal for user interface elements, icons, diagrams, etc., that must be drawn accurately at different sizes".**

## Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

**If you use a foreground color its like using a pencil on a wall, and if you use a background color its like repainting the whole wall, it replaces the foreground.**

## Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

**I'd color the background first, then move on to color the texts, then give the buttons a shodow color.**

## What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

**Font-weight, "Used to turn italic text on or off. Possible values are as follows (you'll rarely use this, unless you want to turn some italic styling off for some reason"**

**font-style, "Sets how bold the text is. This has many values available in case you have many font variants available (such as -light, -normal, -bold, -extrabold, -black, etc.), but realistically you'll rarely use any of them except for normal and bold:"

**font-size, it sets the size of the text**
